        <p>
          I graduated in 2018 from the Northcoder full-time coding bootcamp in
          Manchester.

        <p>
          I am highly motivated, self-driven, hard-working, learn new
          technologies, eager to be a part of the team and become a valuable
          employee of the company. When I'm not not programming, you can find me
          playing video games or learning and reading more about software
          development/engineering.
